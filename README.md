# unicode-general-category

[Unicode General Category](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:General_Category_(Unicode)) validation library built by me around 2018.

## NOTE

I pretend to update this library later for using less space. It's unmaintained for now. For example, this library generates a binary map mapping code point range to specific general category, however I want to omit the code point numbers in this binary map.
